# React Note App

An application for managing notes using ReactJS. \
You can try out the live demo [here](https://note-app-with-routing.vercel.app/).

## Features

You can perform CRUD processes like any other application, but all data is temporary as it is only stored in memory.

## Behind the scene

Before you open the source code of this application, I need to emphasize that this app:

- Is an application that I built to obtain [a certificate of expertise from Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/certificates/JLX1DJRVNZ72).
- Using the class component approach and the function component approach. I did this to understand how `props` works in both approaches.
- No context, just states and props.
